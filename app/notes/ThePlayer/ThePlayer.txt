The player character is currently comprised of 9 objects.
obj_<name>_attack_left
obj_<name>_attack_right
obj_<name>_attack_2_left
obj_<name>_attack_2_right
obj_<name>_attack_3_left
obj_<name>_attack_3_right
obj_<name>_walk_left
obj_<name>_walk_right
obj_<name>_idle


For each object associated with the player there is a parent object that each must inherit.
	Example:
		obj_<name>_walk_left needs to inherit from obj_walk_left_base
		obj_<name>_attack_left inherits from obj_attack_left_base
		obj_<name_attack_2_left inherits from abj_attack_left_base
		Note: All attack left player objects inherit from obj_attack_left_base and attack right player objects inherit from obj_attack_right_base 
		Note: Each attack Create event must specify which attack (ATTACK_1, ATTACK_2, ATTACK_3) it is via the following code
			which_attack=ATTACK_2; // (This should be one of the 3 constants specified above.
			event_inherited();	// must call the event on the parent to finish setting up attack
